# Coin Chaser

### A Coin Collecting Game Built with Pygame

Coin Chaser is a 2d coin collecting game where you control a robot to collect coins while evading a monster.


### How to Play
- Objective: Collect 10 coins to win the game.
- Controls: Use the arrow keys to move your robot.
- Avoid the Monster: If the monster touches your robot, you lose one of your lives.
- Lives: You start with three lives. If you run out, itâ€™s game over.

### About the Game
I created this game as my final project for the University of Helsinki Python MOOC, an online introductory course to programming with Python. It helped me practice my skills in Python, game development with Pygame, and general problem-solving.


### More Info
- To play, make sure you've installed pygame
- All images used in the game were provided by the course.
